
About RepresentMap
------------------

You can use RepresentMap to setup a website that visualizes your local startup 
community on a custom Google map.

This code first came from http://represent.la, our map of the Los Angeles
startup community. The response was extremely positive, so we decided to spread
the love and share the code with other startup communities. Let's visualize
the world's startups together!

RepresentMap was created by:

- PHP5
- MySQL


Installation
------------

Setup should be super easy. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new MySQL database and user.
2. Use phpMyAdmin or another MySQL utility to run the newest SQL file in the /db directory.
3. Open /include/db_example.php with your text editor. Enter your MySQL credentials in there. Rename the file to "db.php".
4. Upload all of the files to your server.
5. Populate your database. We recommend seeding it with some existing data before opening it up to your local community.
6. Challenge your newly-discovered neighbors to ping pong!
